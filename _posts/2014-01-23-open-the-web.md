## Activity 1: Open Sourcing My Pizza Recipe

1. Distribute index cards with a very basic pizza recipe and explain that you are distributing it with an open source license.
2. Invite the students to fork the recipe and make it their own

## Activity 2: About Me Remix

In open source, "forking" is the idea of using someone else's project as the starter point for your own (just like our pizza recipe). I've created a simple "About Me" page. Click the "Remix" button and make the "About Me" page your own.

## Assignments

### 1. Watch

Watch the remaining episodes of [Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) (episodes 2 and 4).

### 2. Blog Post

**Part 1:** Remixes are all around us in the music we listen to, the products we buy, the movies we see, or the ads we drive past on the highway. This weekend find **3** examples of remixes that you encounter in your daily life and write about them on your blog. Be sure to clearly explain what they are a remix of. Include images and video or audio clips if possible.

**Part 2:** What is your opinion of the idea that "everything is a remix?" After viewing Part 4: System Failure, do you agree with the filmmaker about the effects of intellectual property?
