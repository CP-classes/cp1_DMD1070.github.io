Watch the remaining episodes of [Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) (episodes 2 and 4).

### 2. Blog Post

This weekend find **3** examples of remixes that you encounter in your daily life and write about them on your blog. Be sure to clearly explain what they are a remix of. Include images and video or audio clips if possible.

**Part 2:** What is your opinion of the idea that "everything is a remix?" After viewing Part 4: System Failure, do you agree with the filmmaker about the effects of intellectual property?
