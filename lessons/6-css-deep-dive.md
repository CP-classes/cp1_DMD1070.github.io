## Normalize.css

[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is a file that "normalizes" the base appearance of your site across browsers. To use it:

1. [Download the file](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/3.0.0/normalize.css) into your project's directory
2. Link to the CSS file *before* your custom styles (shown below)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>PAGE TITLE</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="normalize.css"> <!-- normalize.css is loaded before our styles -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- our custom style sheet -->
  </head>
  <body>
    .
    .
    .
  </body>
</html>
```

## In-Class Project
