## Midterm Project

<p class="lead">You will be creating a website. As your starting point, you will use a six-sided package that has text on all sides</p>

Choose a 6-sided package/box that has text on all sides. Some examples of boxes are cereal, granola bar, or frozen pizza boxes. Make sure that the box is relatively clean and does not contain food remains as you will be using it in-class over an extended period of time.

Download [the project-template](https://github.com/DMD1070/project-template) and set up the appropriate files like below:

- package (folder)
    - index.html
    - one.html
    - two.html
- css (folder)
    - normalize.css
    - style.css
- img (folder)

Take the box and determine hierarchy of its information. Imagine that the box is a website, markup all of the content on your box. Use the appropriate elements to create the hierarchy. The existing package hierarchy does not have to be maintained. Instead, create hierarchy that makes sense to you and to your design.
