## Learning Resources

All course materials and assignments will be posted to our course website, dmd1070.com. We will reference the website frequently in class.

## Learning Objectives

After this course, you’ll:

- Have an understanding of how to plan, design, and implement a website.
- Demonstrate working knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- Know the principles of responsive design and development for a range of devices (mobile, tablets, desktops).
- Approach web design with a user-centered approach.

## Student Code

You are responsible for acting in accordance with the [University of Connecticut's Student Code](community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-preamble/). Review and become familiar with these expectations.

## Writing Center

The Writing Center is part of the Source for Active Learning, which serves the campus as both a Writing Center and a Q Center. It is located in the Learning Commons area, on the first floor of the Jeremy Richard Library. Our undergraduate writing tutors offer one-on-one tutoring during the day in fall and spring semesters. You can make a Writing Center appointment at


## Recommended Software
The classroom computers should have most of the software we’ll need, but you will be expected to use the following outside of class.

- A text editor (suggestions in **bold** below)
  - **Atom** (http://atom.io) is free and available for both Mac and PC
  - Sublime Text (http://sublimetext.com) is a commercial editor that is free to try, but costs $70 for a license
- A modern web browser
  - **Chrome**
  - FireFox
  - Safari

Additional software may be recommended based on project requirements.


## In-Class Exercises

A large portion of each class meeting will be dedicated to hands-on learning (such as HTML and CSS exercises and project planning).

## Readings and Assignments

1-3 outside of class assignments will be assigned per week. Generally these assignments will be given during our Thursday meeting and due the following Thursday. All class assignments and due dates will be listed on dmd1070.com/assignments.

## Final Project

The final course project will involve planning, designing, and implementing a high quality website. Full requirements will be discussed later in the semester.

## Teaching Method

Overall, you can expect the following:

- We will do lots of hands-on projects covering the technical aspects of building websites.
- We will also cover the non-technical aspects of building websites through discussions, readings, and blog posts.

## General Course Outline

- The building blocks of the web: What is the web? How does it work?
- HTML and CSS
- The craft of web design
  - Typography
  - Layout
  - Responsive design
- The web design process

## Grading

- Assignments and projects: 80%
- Class participation and attendance: 20%

## Attendance

As each class meeting builds upon the previous, attendance is critical to success. It is my expectation that you attend each class. Missing more than two class meetings (both in-person and remote meetings) will result in a 10% subtraction from your overall grade.

## Remote class meetings

Due to my travel schedule, some of our class meetings will occur remotely. When this happens we will use a video conferencing tool (such as Google Hangouts on Air). You may attend these meetings from campus or at home, but are responsible for ensuring that the technology works for you in advance. Failure to attend these class meetings will negatively effect your attendance/participation grade.

## Inclement weather policy

In the event of inclement weather, we may meet remotely (as above) or I may require an assignment in place of our typical class meeting. If we will not meet in person, I will send an email by 4pm as notification.
